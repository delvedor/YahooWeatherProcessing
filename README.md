YahooWeatherProcessing
======================

A lightweight Yahoo Weather library for processing.
Soon there will be the package.jar.

Easy to use:
Create a new .pde file and paste the content of *Weather.java* into it.
After that, in the main *.pde* file use this:

    Weather weather = new Weather();

For use the methods, do:

    weather.method();
    
At the moment there's not a method to change the WOEID code, will be implemented soon.

You can get the code [here](http://woeid.rosselliot.co.nz/).
